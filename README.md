# Analyzing Waze User Churn

Project Overview :

The User Churn Analysis project aimed to tackle the issue of declining user retention within the Waze navigation app. With the overarching goal of reducing monthly user churn, the project utilized a combination of data analytics and machine learning techniques to delve into user behavior patterns and identify key drivers of churn.

The primary objective of the project was to develop effective strategies for mitigating user churn on the Waze app. By understanding the underlying factors contributing to churn and leveraging data-driven insights, the project aimed to enhance user retention rates and foster long-term engagement with the app.
The project was divided into 4 components :
1. Exploratory data analysis ,which included data cleaning , data transfomation , formatting and Data visualization.
2. Hypothesis testing (T-test)
3. Logistic Regression Modelling
4. ML modelling using ensemble learning (Random Forest Classifier and XGBoost classifier)

 The User Churn Analysis project unveiled valuable insights into user churn within the Waze app. Leveraging advanced data analytics, data visualization and ensemble machine learning, the project identified key drivers of churn and developed effective mitigation strategies. these insights can be used to enhance user retention and drive the app's overall growth.
